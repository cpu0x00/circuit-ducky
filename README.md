if you want things to be easy setting up this board you should get it from adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5199) because it will come with bootloader button working out of the box 


2- proximity trinkey

you can get this board from adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5022) [to enter the bootloader mode in this board plug it in and press the button two times]
